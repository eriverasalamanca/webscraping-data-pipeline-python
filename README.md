# Automated Data Scraping & Processing Pipeline (Python)

## Overview
Automated data pipeline that extracts product data from e-commerce sources, processes and normalizes the data, and prepares it for downstream analytics and reporting.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium / Requests
- Pandas
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Automation scripts

## Data Flow
1. Data extraction from web sources
2. Data validation and cleaning
3. Transformation and enrichment
4. Structured output (CSV / JSON) ready for BI tools

## Use Case
This project simulates a real-world data ingestion pipeline commonly used in analytics and BI environments for pricing analysis, promotions monitoring, and reporting automation.

## Next Steps
- Load data into a cloud data warehouse (Snowflake / BigQuery)
- Build BI dashboards on top of the dataset
- Add data quality checks
